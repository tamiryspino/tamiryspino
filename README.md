### Hi there, I am Tamirys Pino! 👋


🎓 I am graduated in Computer Science for Universidade Federal de Alagoas,

🤓 I have a focus on project management, but I'm learning more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I already have some knowledge in Python 🐍 and I'm always trying to improve it.

🔭 I’m currently working on a side project to organize my photos by date and location with Geocoding, Pandas and Python.
